# Test Assignment

#### Things I found most interesting
My name is Yue Yu and I'm more interested in project "Standalone IntelliJ inspections" and "Dependency completion and discovery". Because I had experience using Maven and I learnt to use sbt while doing this test assignment. I feel like they have lots of things in common and I'm interested in becoming more familiar with it.
